## 🔬 Research Summary

### **Title**: Price Prediction of Cryptocurrencies Using Hybrid Machine Learning Models
**Published**: November 2024 in International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews

### **Key Findings**:
- **Traditional time-series models (ARIMA, SARIMAX, Prophet)** significantly outperform machine learning and deep learning models for cryptocurrency price prediction
- **ARIMA achieved the highest performance** with Accuracy: 0.72 and F1-Score: 0.73
- **Deep learning models (LSTM, GRU) performed poorest**, suggesting they struggle with cryptocurrency price patterns
- **Seasonal and trend components** in cryptocurrency prices are crucial for accurate forecasting

### **Research Impact**:
This research provides evidence-based insights that **traditional statistical methods remain more effective than complex ML/DL approaches** for cryptocurrency price prediction, offering practical guidance for investors and trading platforms.
