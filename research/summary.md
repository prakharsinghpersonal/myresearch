## üéØ Abstract
Cryptocurrencies have emerged as a revolutionary financial asset, reshaping global perspectives on currency, transactions, and investment. Unlike traditional currencies governed by central banks and financial institutions, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized platforms that leverage encryption techniques to secure transactions and manage the creation of new currency units. Since Bitcoin's inception in 2009, the cryptocurrency market has expanded significantly, with thousands of digital currencies now circulating. However, the decentralized nature of these assets makes their value susceptible to rapid fluctuations based on user perceptions, market sentiment, and various non-fundamental factors. This paper explores the evolution of cryptocurrency, from the foundational concepts introduced by early pioneers like Wei Dai, who conceptualized a cryptographic payment system, to the current market dynamics where the total cryptocurrency market cap exceeds one trillion USD. Additionally, this paper discusses the importance of automated prediction tools for analyzing cryptocurrency markets. As these digital assets gain popularity among investors, predictive models offer a promising approach to navigating price volatility, enabling informed decision-making in an increasingly complex financial landscape.

## üîç Research Problem
The research addresses the challenge of predicting cryptocurrency prices, which are known for extreme volatility and are primarily driven by user perception, news, and social sentiment rather than traditional economic indicators. This volatility creates both opportunities and risks, emphasizing the need for robust predictive tools to support investor strategies amidst rapid price fluctuations.

## üéØ Research Objectives
1. **Develop a comprehensive cryptocurrency prediction platform** that integrates various machine learning models
2. **Compare the effectiveness** of traditional time-series models vs. machine learning approaches for cryptocurrency price prediction
3. **Create a unified framework** for evaluating different prediction models using standardized metrics
4. **Provide practical insights** for cryptocurrency trading and investment decision-making

## üìä Methodology

### **Research Design**
